## What is Othello/Reversi?
Othello, or Reversi, is a game that is played on an 8x8 board similar to a chessboard. The rules of Othello are quite simple, which is nice because the game is easy to learn for beginners and it isn't too difficult to implement the code for the game logic. But although the game is easy to learn, it is difficult to master some of the complicated strategies and tactics that are needed when playing at a high level.

# othello-web-app
If you were hoping that this was a web application about the [tragedy written by William Shakespeare in 1603](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello), then I am sorry to disappoint you. This is actually just a simple web application for the board game Othello, which is also commonly referred to as Reversi. The current goal of this project is to create something that can be further expanded upon with more features such as bots, multiplayer, etc. I would ultimately like to be able to use this web application to allow myself and others to play against the bots that I create.

## What is Othello/Reversi?
Othello, or Reversi, is a game that is played on an 8x8 board similar to a chessboard. The rules of Othello are quite simple, which is nice because the game is easy to learn for beginners and it isn't too difficult to implement the code for the game logic. But although the game is easy to learn, it is difficult to master some of the complicated strategies and tactics that are needed when playing at a high level. To learn more about the rules and strategies of Othello/Reversi, check out the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi)
